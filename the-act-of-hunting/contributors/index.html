      <p>It is 10 years since hunting foxes with hounds was banned in the UK, yet still, more than 300 hunts are registered in Britain. We want to meet those who want it to stay banned and those who want the ban repealed. We are shooting an independent documentary examining how hunting in the UK has changed after a decade of being outlawed.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you ride with your local hunt. Perhaps you are an anti fox hunting campaigner. Do you support <span>Countryside Alliance</span> or the <span>League Against Cruel Sports</span>? Perhaps you live in a village where the hunt congregate, has their number diminished or grown?</p>
      <p>We want to hear your opinion. You can contact us by emailing <br><a href="mailto:info@theactofhunting.co.uk">info@theactofhunting.co.uk</a> or via Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/theactofhunting" target="_blank">@theactofhunting</a></p>
