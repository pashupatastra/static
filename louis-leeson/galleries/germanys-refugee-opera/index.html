              <li class="slide_intro" id="opera" title="The current mass migration of people, dubbed the 'refugee crisis' by much of the press, has seen millions flee conflicts in Syria and Iraq, but also from Libya, Afghanistan, and from across North and West Africa. A  great many of those fleeing dreamt of reaching Europe, particularly Germany, which took in 200,000 in September 2015 alone. When Pegida, a self-styled 'anti-Islam and anti radicalism' protest group, began to demand an end to the current immigration that Germany was seeing, a group of German and refugee performers decided to counter the right-wing agenda of the protest group. Opera singer Cornelia Lanz and refugee artists from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Nigeria, rewrote Mozart’s unfinished opera, Zaide, to include their own personal stories of flight from violence which they are now touring around Germany. The project focuses mostly on one of the young performers, Khaled 20 from Syria, who had traveled across North Africa, across the Mediterranean, and up through Italy, Switzerland, and Austria to reach Germany.">

From there, he and 403 refugees were put on an 18 metre wooden boat and set to sea. They were eventually rescued by the Italian navy after they were left adrift at night when the motor died. Khaled's only possessions on this journey were his military service exemption certificate, Syrian passport, mobile phone, and picture ID.">
