				<h3 class="top">What is Fixfaff?</h3>
				<p>Fixfaff is an on-demand mobile messaging service for booking travel within 7 days of departure.</p>
				<h3>Why Fixfaff?</h3>
				<p>Booking travel has not progressed much since the 90s. It is still a long-winded, time-consuming, laborious process. When we want to book something most of us spend hours trawling the web doing research, reading reviews and trying to find the best prices. Only to find the prices have usually gone up after making a decision.  And not only that, some of us don’t have a clue what to look for.</p>
				<h3>So we decided it was time to build something that takes the faff out of booking travel.</h3>
				<p>We have a team of experts trained in knowing where to look for the best prices. They know all the nooks and crannies of deal hunting. They are seasoned travel gurus, skilled in making the best recommendations.</p>
				<h3>How it works.</h3>
				<p>Simply tell us what you are looking for and our experts will find you the best possible value options, based on your needs. We will text you these options and make the booking on your behalf once you have decided on something.</p>
				<h3>Do you promote preferred partners?</h3>
				<p>No. We pride ourselves in providing a truly comprehensive and independent service. All recommendations are taken at face value based on what is best for you from our research. We don't push specific brands because of favoured relationships.</p>
				<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
				<p>We charge a flat fee of £5 for every flight booking we make and £10 for every booking that involves accomodation. That’s all.</p>
				<h3>Where is Fixfaff available?</h3>
				<p>We are currently only available for people within specific regions of the UK. We will be expanding to more UK regions very soon.</p>
				<h3>Is there a limit to the type of travel I can book?</h3>
				<p>Yes, at the moment we can only make bookings for flights and accomodation either as packages or stand-alone.</p>
				<h3>How can I get access?</h3>
				<p>We have just released the first version of the Fixfaff mobile app and are currently only able to give access to a limited number of people. We have a waiting list so leave us your details and we will be in touch shortly.</p>
